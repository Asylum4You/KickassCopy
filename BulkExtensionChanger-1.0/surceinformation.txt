I've downloaded this Programm from http://sourceforge.net/projects/b-e-c/?source=typ_redirect
I'm NOT the owner of this Software and don't have to do anything with it!


Description:
This simple tool allows you to change the extensions of files in a given directory (and subdirectories) from one type to another. 
No fluff or overblown GUI; does what it says on the tin.
